        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h4>Charting a Path: My Journey as a Beginner Programmer and Fashion Visionary</h4>
        <p>            
            As a beginner programmer at Altschool and a passionate modest fashion designer, I stand at the exciting intersection of
            two worlds—creativity and technology. My journey is guided by bold goals that blend innovation, empowerment, and the
            pursuit of timeless excellence. These goals are not just aspirations but stepping stones toward a future where fashion
            and technology come together seamlessly.
            
            In the short term, my primary focus is on mastering the foundational concepts of programming. Diving deep into languages
            like Python and JavaScript, I aim to build the technical confidence necessary to create impactful projects. Beyond
            understanding syntax, I seek to develop a problem-solving mindset—one that can tackle both coding challenges and
            creative design hurdles. I am excited to create simple yet meaningful projects, such as an interactive portfolio website
            or a digital lookbook showcasing my modest fashion designs. Participating in coding challenges and hackathons will be
            essential in sharpening my skills and connecting with a network of like-minded innovators.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Midway through my journey, I envision building a fully functional web application that bridges fashion and technology.
            Perhaps a virtual fitting room or a personalized modest fashion styling tool—projects that speak to my passion for both
            design and user-centric solutions. Contributing to open-source projects will also be a priority, as I seek to learn from
            collaborative environments while making meaningful contributions to the developer community. To establish a strong
            digital presence, I plan to create a personal website that showcases not just my fashion creations but also my growing
            portfolio of tech projects.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            In the long term, I dream of launching a fashion academy that integrates technology at its core. This academy will
            empower aspiring designers with both traditional pattern drafting skills and digital innovation, offering virtual
            classes and interactive tools. My ultimate goal is to create a platform where fashion creativity thrives alongside
            technological advancement. Beyond building a business, I aspire to develop software solutions tailored to the unique
            needs of African fashion designers, bringing efficiency and creativity to their work.
            
            Equally important is my desire to give back. As I gain experience, I want to mentor other women who are passionate about
            fashion and technology. Representation matters, and I hope my journey will inspire others to break boundaries and pursue
            their dreams fearlessly.
            
            This path, filled with learning curves and creative breakthroughs, excites me. With a strong foundation in programming
            and a deep passion for fashion, I am confident that I can create innovative solutions that leave a lasting impact. The
            future is bright, and I am ready to code, design, and lead my way to a transformative legacy.
